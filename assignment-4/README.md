# Assignment 4

This is the fourth obligatory assignment in the course IDATT2104 Network Programming.

The assignment was split into 2 tasks, which were similar to assignment three:

  - Create a calculator like in assignment three, but now using UDP for communication.
  - Run a TLS example given in the lecture.
  
The assignment was solved with Java using DatagramSocket and DatagramPacket from java.net.
The server also takes use of threads to handle multiple clients.
