# Assignment 5

This is the fifth obligatory assignment in the course IDATT2104 Network Programming.

The assignment was to create a website that lets the user input, compile and run code.
To do this, Docker was needed on the server side to safely compile and run code.

For now, the compiler only accepts python input.
This can be changed in the future with implementations of Dockerfiles.
