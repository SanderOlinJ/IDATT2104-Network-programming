# Assignment 6

This is the sixth obligatory assignment in the course IDATT2104 Network Programming.

The assignment was to create a WebSocket-server library, based on 'RFC6455: The WebSocket Protocol'.
The WebSocket-server library should be, through socket-programming, able to:
  - Perform handshake between clients and server.
  - Read short messages from clients.
  - Send short messages to connected clients.

In addition, there was a voluntary assignment where you utilize the WebSocket-server to create a drawing board application where multiple clients can connect and draw
at the same time. This repository contains the files related to this voluntary assignment.
